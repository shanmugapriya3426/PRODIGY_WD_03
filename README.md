# Tic Tac Toe Web Application

A browser-based Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
The application allows two players to play interactively with real-time win detection and game state management.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay (Player X and Player O)
- Real-time turn switching
- Automatic win detection
- Draw detection when the board is full
- Game reset functionality
- Interactive and responsive UI
- Visual indication of player moves

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (vanilla)

## Project Structure

├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js

## How It Works

- The game board is represented using HTML elements
- JavaScript tracks the current player and game state
- Click events handle player moves
- Win conditions are checked after each move
- The game resets automatically or via a reset button after completion

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
git clone [https://github.com/shanmugapriya3426/PRODIGY_WD_03.git](https://github.com/shanmugapriya3426/PRODIGY_WD_03.git)

2. Navigate to the project folder:
```

cd PRODIGY_WD_03

```

3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser

No additional setup or dependencies required.

## Learning Outcomes

- Implementing game logic using JavaScript
- Managing application state
- Handling user interactions with event listeners
- Updating the DOM dynamically based on logic
- Writing clean, readable frontend code

That’s exactly what recruiters expect from **entry-level frontend work**.
